BINBOT: A Smarter Way To Manage Waste

In our fast-paced world, separating waste often feels like an afterthought, especially in public places where people are on the go. Juggling work, errands, and personal commitments, tossing everything into one bin seems the easiest option. Even though there are separate sections for wet and dry bins, people in a hurry avoid paying attention to it, the following image shows the same. But this convenience comes at a heavy cost, with recycling rates hovering around a dismal 30%. Plastic waste is a particular challenge, with only 20% recycled and the rest disappearing into landfills or our environment, potentially for hundreds of years. This isn't just an aesthetic issue; it's a public health crisis. Overflowing bins attract pests, and leach toxins, contributing to air and water pollution.

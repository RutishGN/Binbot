BINBOT: A Smarter Way To Manage Waste

In our fast-paced world, separating waste often feels like an afterthought, especially in public places where people are on the go. Juggling work, errands, and personal commitments, tossing everything into one bin seems the easiest option. Even though there are separate sections for wet and dry bins, people in a hurry avoid paying attention to it, the following image shows the same. But this convenience comes at a heavy cost, with recycling rates hovering around a dismal 30%. Plastic waste is a particular challenge, with only 20% recycled and the rest disappearing into landfills or our environment, potentially for hundreds of years. This isn't just an aesthetic issue; it's a public health crisis. Overflowing bins attract pests, and leach toxins, contributing to air and water pollution. 

 We are using "rapberry pi" as main controller in our project 
PROCESS-->> as you can see in daigram there is 
Sensor_0 Which trigger the gate 1 (servo_0) to open 
then user will put there waste one-by-one
at same time sensor camera is activate it scan (takes multiple imgs of waste ) 
provide this data to 'Raspberry PI' ML model will detect the type of waste and guide the user via display visuals & sound where thay can put waste 
after that as per location where our 'Binbot' is placed user will get reward (they can claim rewards by scanning QR code which is present on Binbot's Display
